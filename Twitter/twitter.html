        Welcome to our #Twitter Vader Anslysis Review page!
        <br>
        <br>
        We utilized Twitter API and the Vader Sentiment Analysis to see just how people felt about 
        each of the top 10 restaurants. We quickly found a limitation to this by discovering that 
        tweets older than 1 week from the time of searching are not included in the results.
        <br>
        <br>
        To account for this, we decided that restaurants that received ANY tweets about it in a week span, 
        and therefore contributed to a vader analysis received 0.5 points on the NicKris scale while restaurants 
        that received ANY tweets about it in a week span AND had a higher sentiment score than negative score received a full point.
